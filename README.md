##  Machine Learning for Chemical Engineering
Welcome to the course on Machine Learning for Chemical Engineering! In this course, we will explore the fascinating intersection of machine learning and chemical engineering and understand how these two fields can synergistically work together to solve complex problems and optimize processes in the chemical industry.

##  Class Tasks

### Task 1
Develop a kNN model for regression to predict the bioconcentration factor (BCF) for the given data

### Task 2
Develop a Generalized Linear regression model to predict the Internal energy (U) of saturated vapor for the given pressure data (P)

### Task 3
Develop a Deep Neural Network model to predict the PE for the given input data in a Combine Cycle Power Plant (CCPP)

input data ; Ambient Temperature (AT), V(V), Atmospheric Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), Exhaust Vacuum (V)

output data ; Electric Power (PE)
